    <h1>Industrial italy</h1>

    <p>
      As a night owl, I've always enjoyed staying up late at night.
      <br>
      I appreciate the quietness at the end of the day; I find it soothing for my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, I like to take a ride and explore the area where I live and I've always been fascinated by the industrial structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the fumes, or maybe it's because it's the only production activity that takes place at that hour...
      fascinating and frightening at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this project, I want to highlight some destinations and help other night owls like myself.
    </p>
